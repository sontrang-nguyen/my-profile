			<h2> My Birthday Charity Fundraiser </h2>
			<p> Like I said previously, as soon as this website is up, it will be my birthday. Every year, I try to do some sort of charity or fundraiser to give back to the community for my birthday. This year, I am trying to raise funds for a Coral Reef Research Organisation called: Coral Guardians

				<h3>Why Corals?</h3>
				<img src="images/corals.png" alt="Our Oceans" id="corals">
				<p> For the last 10 years, our oceans have been in critical conditions, mainly our Coral Reefs. Corals are the lungs of our ocean, they fight climate change, protects coastlines from natural disasters and houses 25% of the marine life. But with our reefs slowly dying, in less than 40 years, all coral reefs can be extinct because of pollution. Corals are one of the few things we can still save, and all it takes is for you to understand how important they are. </p>
